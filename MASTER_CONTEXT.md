## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

To ensure a flawless demo and production readiness, address these potential challenges based on Kronospan's requirements:

### 1. Data Parsing and Accuracy Risks
- **Risk:** Inaccurate extraction from diverse sources (e.g., scanned PDFs like historical financials, malformed HTML in emails, or complex Excel structures in WCR/LTL files) leading to data inconsistencies or query failures.
- **Mitigation:** Implement robust parsing with Apache PDFBox (including OCR fallback), Apache POI for Excel validation, and HTML sanitization. Add data validation scripts during import (Phase 1) with 100% accuracy checks against source files. Test with real samples like CY05 PDFs and email logs.

### 2. Multi-Currency and Calculation Complexity
- **Risk:** Errors in handling EUR/PLN/BGN conversions, summations, or variances (e.g., in loan repayments or facility utilizations) due to offline constraints and legacy Java 8 limitations.
- **Mitigation:** Build a dedicated Multi-Currency Calculation Engine with fixed exchange rates configurable offline. Include unit tests for all currency scenarios and integrate into query validation (Phase 2). Reference pain points like seasonality trends in cash variances.

### 3. Air-Gapped Deployment Constraints
- **Risk:** Installation/dependency issues in zero-internet environments (e.g., downloading Ollama models or Maven packages) or compatibility with GDX Spark ARM hardware.
- **Mitigation:** Provide offline installation guides (e.g., USB-based model transfers) and pre-bundle dependencies in the WAR file. Test on Ubuntu with ARM simulation; ensure Java 8 compatibility and document NDA-compliant data handling.

### 4. Performance and Scalability Bottlenecks
- **Risk:** Exceeding sub-3-second response times for complex queries (e.g., multi-table joins across 100+ entities, 200-500 daily queries) or with 15-20 concurrent users.
- **Mitigation:** Optimize SQL queries with indexes (e.g., on company_code, dates). Implement caching in Spring Boot and stress-test in Phase 5. Monitor with H2 tools, targeting 99% uptime.

### 5. Query Flexibility and Edge Cases
- **Risk:** Natural language queries failing on specifics like random company selections, date ranges (e.g., 'as at dd/mm/yyyy'), or flexible reporting (e.g., custom facility types like LTL/WCR/SWAPS).
- **Mitigation:** Enhance AI intent recognition with Kronospan terminology dictionary. Add error handling for invalid inputs and test all 12+ demo scenarios, including variations from form submissions (e.g., directorship changes over periods).

### 6. Security and Compliance Issues
- **Risk:** Unauthorized access in role-based system (Admin/Manager/User) or breaches in NDA-protected data handling.
- **Mitigation:** Use Spring Security for strict RBAC. Implement audit logging for all queries and data access. Document compliance in Phase 5 demo prep.

These mitigations directly address Kronospan's pain points (e.g., quick retrieval, complex querying) and ensure the platform meets C-level expectations for reliability.
